description: Stop AI from generating excessive comments
globs: *.go, *.html, *.js, *.jsx, *.ts, *.tsx

 Do not add comments to code except:

 - When explictly told to do so by the prompt
 - When documenting functions, packages, or structs

 THERE SHOULD BE NO COMMENTS WITHIN A FUNCTION BLOCK UNLESS THE PROMPT REQUESTS COMMENTS. THIS IS IMPORTANT.
 
 Comments include inline comments, such as those starting with // and block comments such as those starting with /*. Just don't add comments unless prompted to. Seriously. Don't do it.
