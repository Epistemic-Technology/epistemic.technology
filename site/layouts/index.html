            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Epistemic Technology builds knowledge-oriented software---software aimed at research, education, knowledge access, and knowledge sharing.</p>
            <p>Since the release of ChatGPT in 2022, artificial intelligence and AI-enabled technologies have evolved at an astounding pace, bringing both tremendous benefits and significant harms. This dual-nature is perhaps nowhere more apparent than in knowledge-oriented fields such as research and education.</p>
            <p>The fundamental premise of Epistemic Technology is that AI is here to stay, that society will have to adapt in unprecedented ways, and that best way to influence how these technologies evolve is to participate in their development and uses.</p>
