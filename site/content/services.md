## Education

We offer single-day workshops for teams of up to 25 people, either in-person or remote. The aim of these workshops is to give your team a head start in thinking about how you use and communicate about AI.

Possible workshops include:

### How to talk to each other about AI

This workshop is intended for multidisciplinary teams where people in different roles might have very different understandings of and experiences with AI. The aim of the workshop is to bridge the gap so that everyone on the team has a shared understanding of AI technologies and how to use them consistently with your values.

For example, developers might use AI tools day-to-day for writing code, while designers might use AI-assisted image editing tools, and others might use chatGPT for drafting communications, and others might not use it at all. All of those people might have radically different perceptions of the strengths, weaknesses, and ethical issues surrounding AI.

#### Outline

- Session 1: How we use AI today
  - Discussion: What tools are you using in your day-to-day work? How about in the rest of your life? How do they help you?
  - Presentation: The landscape of AI tools
- Session 2: Where have we come from? Where are we going?
  - Discussion: Do you remember the first time you used ChatGPT? What was that like? Imagine yourself three years from now. What do you imagine your experience of AI might be then?
  - Presentation: A brief history and possible futures of AI
- Lunch break
- Session 3: AI Ethics and Safety
  - Discussion: What concerns you about AI?
  - Presentation: Ethical and safety issues with AI
  - Discussion: How do these issues affect our work?
- Session 4: Developing a shared agreement about AI
  - Presentation: The jagged frontier of AI
  - Team work: Developing a draft policy on AI usage within the team

### From zero to AI

This is a hands-on workshop where we survey the landscape of AI tools and gain experience in their use. We discuss how to get the most out of these tools using techniques such as chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting. We also look at the bigger picture of AI: what it is, its history, ethical and safety issues, and what the future might bring.

### Custom workshops

Existing workshops can be tailored to your team, or [contact us](/contact/) to discuss developing a custom workshop for your team.

## Consulting

Adopting AI into your workflow or developing AI-enabled products requires navigating a complex ecosystem of technologies and an equally complex array of ethical and social issues. We can help you to navigate these complexities to effectively make use of AI technologies while mitigating their risks.
