Mike has a PhD in History and Philosophy of Science and Technology from the University of Toronto (2016). His dissertation examines attempts by philosophers to model scientific activities using tools and analogies from economics. He has taught college courses in history and philosophy of science, economics and the history of economic thought, writing, and literature.

Mike's PhD and subsequent academic research examined how scientists work together to produce knowledge, a field known as "social epistemology". This reflects his longstanding interest in *how* we work collectively to learn about the world. He has long been interested in how technology interacts with this process, both theoretically and pratically. He is a passionate user of knowledge management and writing tools such as DevonThink, Evernote, Obsidian, Zotero, and Scrivener.

As a father of three young children, a son of a Montessori educator, and a former college teacher, Mike is also very interested in how students, learn throughout their lifelong journey, and about how technologies can facilitate or hinder their efforts.

Mike was tech lead for the Knowledge Commons project with Mesh Research at Michigan State University from 2021-2024, where he led a small team developing technology for open research. He still works with them as a part-time developer.

Mike is experienced with development in Go, PHP (WordPress and Laravel), React, SolidJS, Typescript, and Python. He has administered AWS services extensively, and is proficient with standard development tools and processes including git, CI/CD, Docker, and automated testing.

## The Team

As this is a new endeavor, Mike is currently the sole member of the Epistemic Technology team, but there are plans to grow! If you are interested in collaborating, please [contact us](/contact).
