Epistemic Technology builds knowledge-oriented software for the era of AI.

Knowledge-oriented software is aimed at empowering the production, sharing, and use of knowledge. This encompasses educational technology and research tools, but also personal knowledge management, discovery, curation, and collaboration.

Never before has humanity's relationship with knowledge evolved so rapidly. The printing press took centuries for its full effects to be realized. The internet, decades. Chatbots powered by Large Language Models changed how we work, think, and learn almost overnight, and just two years after the release of ChatGPT to the world, everything from how we write code to how we search the web to how we research and learn has changed dramatically.

Epistemic Technology is fundamentally optimistic about the potential of artificial intelligence to improve how we learn about and take action in the world. However, it is also born out of concern about the potential for a world in which we delegate our most distinctive human qualities of creativity and reasoning to artificial "assistants", and the loss of agency that inevitably follows.

In building new technologies and tools, Epistemic Technology hopes to be able to contribute to an ongoing conversation about how AI-powered technologies can be used responsibly and how we all can prosper in this new era. Nobody knows where all of this is headed or how quickly, only by "getting our hands dirty" can we meaningfully contribute toward nudging humanity in a better direction.

Finally, Epistemic Technology is intended to be a means of helping others with similar missions to accomplish their goals, whether that be through delivering high-quality knowledge-oriented software, or through facilitating others in building their own products or in rethinking how they navigate the challenges of the AI age.
