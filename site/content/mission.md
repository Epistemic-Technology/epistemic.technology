Our mission is to assist with the adoption of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies in a thoughtful way.

From large language models powering increasingly intelligent chat bots to services creating more and more realistic images and videos to emerging "agents" capable of performing complex tasks autonomously, generative AI has already transformed the way we live and work. There is every reason to expect that these advancements will continue, though nobody knows how quickly or in exactly what direction.

If you are a business or other organization trying to plan for the future, or adapt to the present, you cannot ignore AI. But there are pitfalls. LLM-powered chat bots are famous both for "hallucinating" (reporting fiction as fact) and for reproducing damaging gender, racial, and other biases. Generative AI of all kinds potentially violates creators' intellectual property rights, and raises privacy concerns both regarding the data used for training models and for the data supplied to them through user interactions. The productivity enhancements enabled by AI tools might lead to deskilling in the long term as people lose, or fail to learn, vital competencies.

Keeping up with all of these issues is overwhelming, and determining what effect they could have on your organization is yet more so. Our mission is to help you understand and navigate these complex issues so that you are not left behind but neither are you charging in blind. A "thoughtful" approach means one where we consider your potential use cases, what relevant technologies are available now and might be coming in the future, survey the full range of potential benefits, costs, and dangers of adoption, have an experimental attitude, and create mechanisms for ongoing evaluation of these experiments to ensure that your organization is always learning.

Beyond assisting individual clients, we hope to play a small part in shaping the future of AI for everyone. As much as many of us have experienced the benefits of AI-powered tools in our lives, and we see the transformative potential of AI research, we have also experienced the torrent of generic, shallow content churned out by them ("AI Slop"), the unhelpful AI features shoved into seemingly every application, and the worrying increase in misinformation, accidental and intended. We know about the troubling ways algorithmic bias has impacted people who need healthcare or are facing criminal sentencing. We see the environmental costs of the data centers needed to train more and more powerful models. We worry about the ways in which artificial intelligence powers the surveillance state. And we believe that these are concerns that all of us should be grappling with, not just those at the heads of giant technology firms or government.

By helping organizations take a thoughtful approach to implementing AI, we hope to help find a way to a better future, where the benefits of AI are truly widespread and the pitfalls, harms, and risks are mitigated, if not completely avoided.
