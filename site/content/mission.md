Never before has humanity's relationship with knowledge evolved so rapidly. The printing press took centuries for its full effects to be realized. The internet, decades. Chatbots powered by Large Language Models changed how we work, think, and learn almost overnight, and just two years after the release of ChatGPT to the world, everything from how we write code to how we search the web to how we research and learn has changed dramatically.

The primary mission of Epistemic Technology is to build software for this new emerging world in a way that preserves human agency and capability.

Overall, we are optimistic about the potential of artificial intelligence to improve how we learn about and take action in the world. However, we worry about a world in which we delegate our most distinctive human qualities of creativity and reasoning to artificial "assistants", and the loss of agency that inevitably comes with that. And we worry about the world in which our children are growing up, one in which it seems people are increasingly losing their abilities to learn about and reflect on the world.

As we build, we hope to be able to contribute to an ongoing conversation about how AI-powered technologies can be used responsibly and how we all can prosper in this new era. Nobody knows where all of this is headed or how quickly, but we believe that only by "getting our hands dirty" can we meaningfully contribute toward nudging humanity in a better direction.

Finally, we hope to help others with similar missions to accomplish their goals, whether that be through delivering high-quality knowledge-oriented software, or through facilitating others in gaining the knowledge necessary to accomplish their own goals.
