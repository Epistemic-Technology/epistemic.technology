# The Global AI Arms Race: A New Cold War

*Published: 2024-01-23*

The international competition in artificial intelligence has intensified dramatically since 2020. China's announcement of its ¥1.7 trillion ($248 billion) AI investment plan for 2020-2025 marked a turning point in the global AI race. The United States responded with the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, allocating $280 billion for semiconductor research and AI development.

## Computing Infrastructure Battle

The race for AI computing power has become a key battleground. China's Sunway OceanLight supercomputer, revealed in 2023, achieves 1.3 exaflops of AI-specific computing power using 41,888 Chinese-designed SW26010-Pro processors. This compares to the US Department of Energy's Frontier system, which delivers 1.7 exaflops using 8,730 AMD MI250X GPUs.

## Patent Competition

The patent landscape reveals the intensity of competition. In 2023, Chinese entities filed 43,000 AI-related patents, accounting for 37.9% of global AI patents. The United States followed with 35,000 patents (31.2%), while the European Union filed 15,000 patents (13.4%). Microsoft leads individual companies with 18,365 active AI patents.

## Research Investment

Research funding has reached unprecedented levels. The EU's Horizon Europe program allocated €13.6 billion for AI research between 2021-2027. South Korea's AI semiconductor initiative invested ₩1.8 trillion ($1.4 billion) in 2023 alone. Japan's RIKEN center operates the world's largest GPU cluster for AI research, with 4,896 NVIDIA A100 GPUs providing 2.8 exaflops of AI computing power.

## Strategic Initiatives

National AI strategies have become increasingly sophisticated. Israel's AI defense program, with a $1.5 billion budget, focuses on autonomous systems development. India's Digital India initiative trained 1.2 million citizens in AI skills during 2023, while establishing 7 new AI research centers across IIT campuses.

The competition continues to escalate, with the World Economic Forum 2024 report identifying AI sovereignty as a top-5 global risk. Countries invested a combined $462 billion in AI development during 2023, marking a 41% increase from 2022.
