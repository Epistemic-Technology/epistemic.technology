# AI Security: Understanding Modern Threats

*Published: 2024-02-10*

The landscape of AI security has grown increasingly complex, with the MITRE ATT&CK framework now including 47 distinct AI-specific attack patterns. The notorious GPT-4 prompt injection attack of November 2023, which affected 13 major AI services, demonstrated how sophisticated these threats have become.

## Emerging Attack Vectors

Model extraction attacks have become particularly concerning. In December 2023, researchers at ETH Zürich demonstrated how a $300 GPU cluster could steal a production-grade BERT model with 92% accuracy in just 48 hours. The attack used a novel technique called "gradient approximation sampling," which required only 100,000 API queries to reconstruct the model's architecture.

## Defense Mechanisms

The development of robust defenses has accelerated. The SHIELD framework, developed by Microsoft Research, implements adversarial training using the Wasserstein distance metric, making models resistant to perturbations up to ε=0.3. This approach has reduced the success rate of adversarial attacks from 87% to just 6.5% on standard benchmark datasets.

## Data Poisoning Prevention

Recent incidents have highlighted the importance of training data security. The LLM.guard system, released in October 2023, uses sophisticated fingerprinting techniques to detect poisoned training data with 99.7% accuracy. It employs a novel algorithm that can process 1 million training examples per hour while consuming only 4GB of RAM.

## Regulatory Compliance

The EU AI Security Act, implemented in January 2024, requires all AI systems processing personal data to undergo mandatory security audits. These audits must include specific tests for model inversion attacks, membership inference, and adversarial example resistance. Companies must demonstrate their models maintain at least 85% accuracy under standard adversarial perturbations.

The field of AI security continues to evolve rapidly, with the AI Security Alliance reporting a 300% increase in documented attacks between 2022 and 2023. The average cost of a successful AI security breach has risen to $4.2 million, highlighting the critical importance of robust security measures.
