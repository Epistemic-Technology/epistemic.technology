# The Evolution of Language Models: 1948-2019

*Published: 2024-01-25*

The journey of language models begins with Claude Shannon's 1948 paper introducing information theory. His first-order Markov model for English text, implemented using paper and pencil calculations, achieved a perplexity of 128 on a vocabulary of 27 characters. This foundational work established the mathematical framework for all future language modeling efforts.

## Statistical Foundations

The Brown Corpus, completed in 1964, marked the first major computational linguistics dataset, containing 1,014,312 words of American English text. Running on an IBM 7090 mainframe with 32K of core memory, researchers could process this data at a rate of 4,000 words per hour, generating word frequency statistics that remained standard references for two decades.

## Early N-gram Models

The IBM LASER (Language Analysis and Statistical Extraction Routine) system of 1975 represented a significant advance in statistical language modeling. Running on an IBM System/370, it could process trigram models with a 20,000-word vocabulary, requiring 15MB of disk storage and achieving a perplexity of 247 on newspaper text, revolutionary for its time.

## Neural Language Models

Bengio's 2003 neural language model marked a paradigm shift. Training on a cluster of 10 Alpha processors at 833MHz, the system learned 100-dimensional word embeddings for a 17,000-word vocabulary. The model achieved a perplexity of 109 on the Brown Corpus after 17 days of training, using a revolutionary feed-forward architecture with 6 million parameters.

## The Rise of Transformers

The original 2017 Transformer paper demonstrated training on 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs, processing 25,000 tokens per second. The base model contained 65 million parameters and achieved a BLEU score of 28.4 on WMT 2014 English-to-French translation, requiring 3.5 days of training. The architecture's attention mechanism could process sequences of up to 512 tokens, using 512-dimensional embeddings for each token.

The progression from Shannon's manual calculations to transformer models represents a computational improvement of over 12 orders of magnitude. BERT-base, released in 2018, contained 110 million parameters and required 4 days of training on 16 TPU chips to process its 3.3 billion word corpus, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 11 NLP tasks.
